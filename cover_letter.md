Hiring Manager,<br>
Neo4j

**Subject:** Application for Developer Advocate - India

Dear Hiring Team at Neo4j,

I’m very excited to apply for the Developer Advocate role at Neo4j. 

Neo4j played a formative role in my journey into analytics - earning the **Neo4j Certified Professional** credential was a catalyst that pushed me to think more deeply about data relationships, correctness, and explainability. 

That mindset ultimately led me to build **datalabx**, an open-source Python framework for data diagnostics and preparation.

Through datalabx, I’ve experienced developer advocacy hands-on: building tools with empathy for real developer pain points, writing clear documentation and examples, responding to user feedback, and continuously improving usability.

The framework focuses on surfacing hidden data issues and preventing silent errors - principles that strongly align with Neo4j’s mission of transforming connected data into meaningful knowledge.

I enjoy being both **a builder and an educator**, and I’m motivated by helping developers succeed through clear guidance, tooling, and community engagement. 

With my technical background, open-source experience, and comfort speaking with developers across contexts, I’d love to help grow and support the Neo4j developer community in India.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d be excited to contribute to Neo4j’s mission and developer ecosystem.

Warm regards,<br>
Kshitij Sharma<br>
