## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

### datalabx - Open-Source Python Data Diagnostics Library

**Open-Source Project**<br>
Python, Pandas, Polars, Numpy, Matplotlib<br>
*(v0.1 Pre-release)*<br>
**GitHub**: https://github.com/TheDucky-2/datalabx
**API Docs**: https://theducky-2.github.io/datalabx/

- Designed and built a modular Python library for diagnosing and cleaning highly dirty tabular datasets **(77–90% invalid or inconsistent values)**, implementing type-aware diagnostics for numerical, text, categorical, and datetime columns with **20+ regex rules**.  
- Built a pandas-facing API backed by a Polars engine, efficiently processing **5–10M row** datasets and reducing runtime from **30+ seconds to ~5–10 seconds** via vectorized expressions.  
- Developed **column-level diagnostics** exposing formatting errors, coercion risks, missingness patterns, invalid values, and conversion failures to **improve auditability**.  
- Designed explicit, **user-controlled cleaning workflows** to prevent silent coercion and **unintended data loss**.  
- Wrote structured documentation, API references, workflow guides while published and packaged **7 alpha/beta releases** to TestPyPI using modern Python packaging standards **(pyproject.toml)**.

### Power BI & Analytics Projects

**Anti-Money Laundering Analysis - Power BI**

**GitHub**: https://github.com/TheDucky-2/Anti-Money-Laundering-Analysis

- Built interactive **Power BI dashboards** for exploratory and performance analysis.
- **Cleaned, transformed**, and **validated** datasets prior to visualization using Python.
- Identified **trends, correlations, and actionable insights** aligned with business-style questions.
- Designed dashboards emphasizing **clarity, usability, and decision support**.
- Documented **metrics, assumptions, and findings** to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Author & Maintainer - datalabx (Open-Source)**
Self-directed | 2025 - Present
Python, Pandas, Polars, Matplotlib, NumPy, Data Diagnostics, API Design, Documentation

- Designed and built a diagnosis-first analytics framework to help users understand and safely visualize highly messy tabular datasets **(77–90% invalid or inconsistent values)**.
- Developed diagnostic-backed visualizations for **missingness patterns, categorical distributions, numeric anomalies, and conversion failures**, enabling faster and more confident exploratory analysis.
- Built a pandas-friendly public API backed by a Polars execution engine, supporting interactive analysis on datasets with **5–10 million rows**.
- Reduced diagnostic and exploratory runtime from **30+ seconds to ~5–10 seconds**, improving responsiveness for visualization-driven workflows.
- Implemented explicit, user-controlled data transformation steps to prevent silent coercion and misleading charts.
- Designed workflows that mirror real product use cases:
**raw data -> diagnostics -> visualization -> cleaning -> re-visualization.**
- Wrote structured documentation, workflow guides, and API references to support adoption by **analysts and data scientists**.
- Packaged, versioned, and published multiple **alpha/beta releases** using modern Python packaging standards.
- Set up CI pipelines to **automatically build and deploy documentation** to GitHub Pages.
