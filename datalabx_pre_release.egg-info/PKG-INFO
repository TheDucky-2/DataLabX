**A diagnosis-first data quality and preparation framework for real-world data.**

datalabx is a Python library designed to help you understand, diagnose, and safely prepare messy datasets - before analysis or modeling.

Most data failures don’t happen during modeling.
They happen earlier: **during data understanding, cleaning, and unsafe transformations.**

datalabx exists to fix that.

## What is datalabx?

**datalabx is a structured framework for working with messy, real-world data.**

It is designed for datasets where:

- Values are inconsistent, invalid, or misleading

- Missing data appears in many hidden forms

- Column types are unclear or mixed

- Blind automation is risky

Instead of guessing or silently coercing data, datalabx focuses on:

- **Clarity**

- **Control**

- **Explainability**

datalabx helps you understand what your data is doing before deciding what to do with it.

## Who is datalabx for?

datalabx is built for:

- Analysts & Data Scientists working with messy, real-world datasets

- Researchers & Engineers needing structured data diagnostics

- Beginners who want safe, guided workflows

- Advanced users who want transparency instead of black boxes

**If you care about well-understood data, datalabx is for you.**

## Core Philosophy

**Diagnosis-first, not automation-first.**

``datalabx assumes that your data is dirty by default.``

Instead of hiding problems, it:

- detects them

- explains them

- lets you decide what to do

datalabx is built around a simple idea: 

> Different data types need different thinking

datalabx separates workflows by data type:

- Numerical

- Categorical

- Text

- Datetime

- (Graph data coming soon)

This keeps workflows:

- **clear**

- **safe**

- **reproducible**

## What makes datalabx different?

- Designed for extremely messy datasets **(≈77–90% invalid or inconsistent values)**

- Tested on datasets with **5-10 million rows**

- **Type-aware** diagnosis and cleaning

- **Regex-based detection** of hidden issues

- Structured, **beginner-safe APIs**

- Human-friendly documentation

datalabx combines:

- **power for advanced users**

- **safety and clarity for beginners**

## How datalabx Works

With datalabx, you typically:

- Load data

- Diagnose structure, types, and issues

- Analyze missingness and inconsistencies

- Apply type-specific cleaning & preprocessing

- Compute statistics and distributions

- Visualize behavior and patterns

**Each step is explicit, modular, and explainable.**

## Current Version: v0.1 (Pre-Release)

#### Focus in v0.1

Tabular data workflows, including:

- Data loading (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet)

- Data diagnosis & dirty data detection

- Missingness analysis & visualization

- Numerical & categorical workflows

- Cleaning & preprocessing

- Statistical computations

- Matplotlib-based visualizations

- Beginner-friendly documentation & workflow guides

**Pandas** is fully supported.
**Polars** is used internally for performance in selected components.

## Installation (v0.1 Pre-Release)

datalabx is available on **TestPyPI** for early testing and feedback.

You can now Install datalabx pre-release using **pip**:

``pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple datalabx-pre-release==0.1.0b9``

### Why this long command? 

That is because datalabx itself is downloaded from TestPyPI, while required dependencies (such as pandas) are downloaded from **PyPI**.

### Importing datalabx
```python
import datalabx
```

### Updating to the Latest TestPyPI Version

If you already installed an earlier pre-release version of datalabx from TestPyPI, you can upgrade to the latest test version using:

``pip install --upgrade --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple datalabx-pre-release``

This ensures you always get the most recent pre-release version available on TestPyPI.

**⚠️ Note:**

This is a pre-release version and is not yet intended for production use.

## Why would I even use datalabx?

**Because most data problems don’t come from bad models - they come from poor data understanding.**

datalabx is built to feel like:

> Someone sitting next to you, explaining what your data is doing and why.
