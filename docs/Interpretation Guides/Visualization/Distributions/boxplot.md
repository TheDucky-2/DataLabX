# Boxplot Interpretation
------------------------
        
## Box:
-------

- Inside a box plot, we will obviously have a...box, duh!
    
### **Pattern**

- A box represents the middle 50% of data, or the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR).

- Top of the box (right side of the box, if horizontal orientation) is 3rd Quartile (the value below which 75% of data lies).

- Line inside the box represents the median value (the value below which 50% of data lies).

- Bottom of the box (left side of the box, if horizontal orientation) is 1st Quartile ( the value below which 25% of data lies).

#### **How to Read**

- If the box is wide, it has high variability (data values are very different from each other)
- If the box is narrow, it has high variability (data values are quite similar)

## Whiskers:
------------

### **Pattern**

- Whiskers look like a handle you push while filling air in your cycle tyre.
- Lower Whisker (left if horizontal): It is the lower boundary ( Q1 - (1.5 * IQR))
- Upper Whisker (right if horizontal) : It is the upper boundary (Q3 + (1.5 * IQR))

#### **How to Read**

- If whiskers are short, data is tightly clustered (grouped together)
- If whiskers are long, data is spread out (high standard deviation)

## Outliers:
------------

### **Pattern**

Outliers look like crax rings.

- Outliers are values that are beyond whiskers. These points are plotted individually.
- They represent extremely low or high values.
    
#### **How to Read**

- If many points are grouped together on one side, the distribution of data is skewed

## Skewness:
------------

Skewness can be interpreted by direction of longer whiskers and position of median.

#### **How to Read**

- If median is near bottom of box and upper whisker is long, data has positive skewness (right skewed)
- If median is near top of box and lower whisker is long, data has negative skewness (left skewed)

## Symmetry:
------------

If whiskers are equal in length and median is centered (median = mean), data is roughly normal.
