# Histogram Interpretation
--------------------------
        
A histogram is like a bar chart for numerical data. It shows how your data is distributed by dividing values into ranges called bins.

### Intuition:

- Suppose you made many buildings (bins) of same width, out of lego. 📊
- You decide the width of your buildings and start putting lego pieces of similar width on top of each other.
- The width of your lego bricks will decide how many pieces can be stacked together.
- Highest building would be the one having maximum number of lego pieces placed over one another.
- The size (height) of this building is called 'bin height'.

### Components:

**Axes:**

- X-axis shows the range of values. (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40)
- Y-axis shows the count or frequency of data points falling in that bin. (how tall the building is)

**Bin-Height:**

- If bins are tall, they have a lot of points (many legos stacked over one another)
- If bins are small, they have fewer data points (not many legos stacked over one another)

**Bin-width**

- If bin is wide, histogram looks smoother but most of the points merge together in less number of bins.
- If bin is narrow, histogram looks very noisy however it may reveal important detail.

### Shape of Distribution:

1. ``Normal Distribution/Bell Curve``: 
    Looks like a curved scenery hill.
    Most values lie in the middle, few at extremes.

2. ``Right Skewed``:  
    Right skewed data looks like the tail of godzilla pointing to the right.
    Many small values, few large ones.

3. ``Left Skewed``:
    Left Skewed data looks like the tail of godzilla pointing to the left.
    Many large values, few small ones.

4. ``Uniform Distribution``:
    Looks like all buildings are of the same height.
    All bins (buildings) are roughly equal. All values are equally distributed.

5. ``BiModal/MultiModal``:
    Looks like you have now drawn 2 hills in your scenery as there are now two or more peaks.
    Indicates subgroups in your data.

### Centering and Spread of Data:

- The center of distribution is where highest bins (buildings) are clustered.
- The width of your bins reflect the variability of data. (like something varying from 0 to 100, other from -1000000 to +1000000)
- If the data does not vary a lot (like body temp, from 96 to 104), data has low spread.
- If data varies a lot (like income, from 10000 to 100000000), data has wide spread.

### Unusual Features:

- Gaps between bins may represent missing or rare range of values.
- Outliers may appear as isolated bins (buildings) far away from the rest. (like someone living alone far away in a jungle)

### Important Points:

- Choice of number of bins affect how a histogram would be interpreted.
- Long Tails in a distribution means skewness.
