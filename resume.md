## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

### datalabx - Open-Source Python Data Diagnostics Library

**Open-Source Project**<br>
Python, Pandas, Polars, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn<br>
*(v0.1 Pre-release)*<br>
**GitHub**: https://github.com/TheDucky-2/datalabx<br>
**API Docs**: https://theducky-2.github.io/datalabx/

- Built and maintain a diagnosis-first data quality and preparation library for messy real-world tabular data, emphasizing **correctness, transparency, and safe decision-making**.
- Designed a modular **end-to-end system** covering data loading, diagnosis, visualization, cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.
- Implemented type-aware diagnostics and explicit cleaning workflows, avoiding **silent coercion and enabling auditability** of transformation failures.
- Engineered a **pandas-friendly API** backed by a Polars execution engine, improving performance and scalability on large datasets.
- Owned the **full lifecycle** of the project: Architecture, Development, Testing, CI/CD, Documentation (API, guides, foundations), Versioning, and Releases.

### Power BI & Analytics Projects

**Anti-Money Laundering Analysis - Power BI**

**GitHub**: https://github.com/TheDucky-2/Anti-Money-Laundering-Analysis

- Built interactive **Power BI dashboards** for exploratory and performance analysis.
- **Cleaned, transformed**, and **validated** datasets prior to visualization using Python.
- Identified **trends, correlations, and actionable insights** aligned with business-style questions.
- Designed dashboards emphasizing **clarity, usability, and decision support**.
- Documented **metrics, assumptions, and findings** to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Author & Maintainer - datalabx (Open-Source)**<br>
Self-directed | 2025 - Present<br>
Python, Pandas, Polars, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Data Diagnostics, API Design, Documentation

- Designed and built **datalabx**, a diagnosis-first data quality and preparation framework for messy real-world tabular datasets, emphasizing **correctness, transparency, auditability, and interpretable reasoning**.
- Architected a modular Python library covering the **full data lifecycle**: loading -> diagnosis -> visualization -> cleaning -> preprocessing -> statistical analysis, with clearly separated API, workflow guides, and conceptual foundations.
- Implemented type-aware diagnostics for numerical, categorical, text, and datetime data, surfacing **invalid values, formatting inconsistencies, missingness patterns, and coercion risks**.
- Developed explicit, user-controlled cleaning workflows, **avoiding silent type coercion and unintended data loss**, with column-level failure tracking for auditability.
- Built a pandas-friendly public API backed by a Polars execution engine, enabling efficient processing of datasets with **5-10 million rows**, and added backend flexibility **(NumPy/PyArrow)**.
- Reduced diagnostic runtime from **30+ seconds** to **~5-10 seconds** on large datasets through vectorized expressions and backend abstraction.
- Implemented reusable components for statistical summaries, distributions, correlations, and outlier detection, combined with **diagnosis-backed visualizations** for missingness, categorical distributions, and numerical patterns.
- Authored foundations documentation to teach reasoning about **messy data, explain diagnostics, and guide safe decision-making** - separate from API reference and workflow guides.
- Established documentation standards including API references, workflow guides, conceptual foundations, and example-driven notebooks, generated with **pdoc**.
- Packaged, versioned, and published the library to TestPyPI following modern Python packaging standards **(pyproject.toml)**, with full **CI/CD automation** to deploy documentation and tests.
- Maintained the codebase through iterative refactoring, bug fixes, logging improvements, and documentation updates, ensuring **stability, usability, and long-term maintainability as a solo developer**.
