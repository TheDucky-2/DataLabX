# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of **DataLab** pledge to:

- Be respectful, inclusive, and supportive.
- Collaborate constructively, focusing on ideas, not individuals.
- Promote an environment where everyone feels safe to ask questions, propose changes, and participate.

We value **diversity**, **learning**, and **curiosity**, and we want DataLab to be a positive space for anyone, regardless of background, experience level, or identity.

Our goal is to prioritize **understanding, transparency, and safe practices** in data work and the same applies to how we interact with each other.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment:

- Treat everyone with **respect and courtesy**, regardless of experience level.  
- Be thoughtful in discussions, especially regarding design, contributions, and critiques.  
- Value clarity over cleverness - in code, comments, and communication.  
- Ask questions freely and encourage **learning and shared understanding**.  
- Give constructive feedback with specific, actionable suggestions.  
- Be mindful of the **diagnosis-first philosophy**.  

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.  
- Disrespectful or dismissive responses to questions or contributions.  
- Harassment of any kind, including but not limited to sexual-harassment, offensive language, unwanted contact, or discrimination.  
- Ignoring the boundaries of the project’s philosophy **(e.g., adding unsafe, hidden, or silent transformations in data code without discussion)**.  
- Public shaming or call-outs - all feedback should be **constructive and professional**.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.  

- Reports of unacceptable behavior should be made via email to **datalab.project@protonmail.com**.  
- Maintain a **respectful, private conversation** to address the issue.  
- Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from contributing.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to **all interactions** in project spaces including:

- GitHub issues and pull requests  
- Discussions and chat platforms related to the project  
- Emails and other communications regarding DataLab contributions

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), with edits to align with DataLab’s philosophy of **careful, thoughtful and diagnosis-first contributions**.

## Final Note

DataLab exists because messy data silently breaks real systems.  

We aim for the same principle in community interactions: **Thoughtful, Safe, Transparent, and Respectful Collaboration**.

Thank you for being part of this effort.
